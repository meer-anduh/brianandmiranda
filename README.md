we just have pictures here documenting our adventures!

# TO DO
  1. Create an all page which shows a whole gallery of every picture in the site, randomized.
      
      a) Place "all photos" button next to "about"
      
  2. Make the gallery scaleable, querying a server or folder and automatically populating images
  3. Make the gallery pictures redirect to another page with more pictures of that day. [ALMOST DONE]
  4. Create smoother transitions between pages
