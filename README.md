TO DO
  1. Create a search function, where we can search dates or places
      
      a) Place search bar next to "about"
      
      b) Learn php
  2. Make the gallery scaleable, querying a server or folder and automatically populating images
  3. Make the gallery pictures redirect to another page with more pictures of that day.
